**FUZZY LOGIC GATE DSL**

This project is a domain specific language designed for creating, evaluating, and analyzing filly logic gates using variables and scopes.
This simulates fuzzy logic functions by defining logic gates, assigning values, and evaluating. At this time, my DSL supports
the operations: union, intersection, complement, addition, multiplication, XOR, and alpha-cut on sets
